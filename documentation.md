## Documentation Entry – Project Thoughts & Preparation

When I started thinking about my final project, I wanted to solve a real problem for myself: tracking my working hours, overtime, and earnings in a way that existing tools don’t fully cover for me.

My first idea was to write a simple Python script. But then I realized I want to actually **use** this tool on my phone or anywhere. So I researched how to turn Python code into a web app and found **Streamlit**, which looks easy to use and perfect for connecting Python logic to a web interface.

### What I Planned

- The core functions I’d need (like saving time entries, calculating overtime, etc.)
- How to keep personal settings flexible (hourly wage, working days, etc.)
- How to store data (JSON or CSV)
- How Streamlit can help build the UI

---

### Preparing for the Presentation Helped Me

- Clarify my project’s scope
- Define which challenges to expect
- Split my work into clear steps:
  - first build the Python logic
  - then wrap it in Streamlit

---

**Next step:** I’ll start coding the core logic before moving on to building the Streamlit interface.
